# Overview

The data I was analyzing was statistics I got from the FBI's website about hatecrime in America.

I was interested at looking at some trends in the data and also familairizing myself with the pandas and altair libraries

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used GitColab to do most of the project because the dataset was so large that it was faster to run online. I then downloaded it to VS Code to finalize it.

I used Python, Pandas, and Altair for my data analysis.

# Future Work

* There are several charts I would like to improve to make more readable
* Filter the data better at the beginning
* Learn how to save the results to a new CSV file
